Using a complete database for the scientiﬁc specialty of research about “steel structures,” we show that betweenness centrality of an existing node is a signiﬁcantly better predictor of preferential attachment by new entrants than degree or closeness centrality. During the growth of a network, preferential attachment shifts from (local) degree centrality to betweenness centrality as a global measure. An interpretation is that supervisors of PhD projects and postdocs broker between new entrants and the already existing network, and thus become focal to preferential attachment. Because of this mediation, scholarly networks can be expected to develop differently from networks which are predicated on preferential attachment to nodes with high degree centrality.},

Further, a scientist’s years of research experience are positively related with both types of collaboration. Work experience in ﬁrms or governmental organizations increases the propensity of interdisciplinary collaborations, but decreases that of disciplinary collaborations. Disciplinary collaborations occur more frequent in basic disciplines; interdisciplinary collaborations more in strategic disciplines. We also found that in both types of disciplines, disciplinary collaborations contribute more to career development than interdisciplinary collaborations. We conclude with three recommendations for science and innovation policy, while emphasising the need to distinguish between different scientiﬁc disciplines.},

In this paper, we study the relationships between collaboration and productivity in four disciplines, Organic Chemistry, Virology, Mathematics and Computer Science. Our studyfound that the productivity is correlated with collaboration in general, but the correlation could be positive or negative on the basis of which aspect of collaboration to measure, i.e., the scale or scope of the collaboration. The correlation becomes stronger as individual scientists progress through various stages of their career. Furthermore, experimental disciplines, such as Organic Chemistry and Virology, have shown stronger correlation coefﬁcients than theoretical ones such as Mathematics and Computer Science.},

Greater research impact not only inspires scholars to continue their research, but also increases the possibility of a larger research budget from sponsors. Given the importance of research impact, this study proposes that utilizing social capital embedded in a social structure is an effective way to achieve more research impact. The contribution of this study is to deﬁne six indicators of social capital (degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, proliﬁc co-author count, team exploration, and publishing tenure) and investigate how these indicators interact and affect citations for publications. A total of 137 Information Systems scholars from the Social Science Citation Index database were selected to test the hypothesized relationships. The results show that betweenness centrality plays the most important role in taking advantage of non-redundant resources in a co-authorship network, thereby signiﬁcantly affecting citations for publications. In addition, we found that proliﬁc co-author count, team exploration, and publishing tenure all have indirect effects on citation count. Speciﬁcally, co-authoring with proliﬁc scholars helps researchers develop centralities and, in turn, generate higher numbers of citations. Researchers with longer publishing tenure tend to have higher degree centrality. When they collaborate more with different scholars, they achieve more closeness and betweenness centralities, but risk being distrusted by proliﬁc scholars and losing chances to co-author with them. Finally, implications of ﬁndings and recommendations for future research are discussed.},

This paper analyses the structure of co-authorship networks in three different ﬁelds (Nanoscience, Pharmacology and Statistics) in Spain over a three-year period (2006–2008) and explores the relationship between the research performance of scientists and their position in co-authorship networks. A denser co-authorship network is found in the two experimental ﬁelds than in Statistics, where the network is of a less connected and more fragmented nature. Using the g-index as a proxy for individual research performance, a Poisson regression model is used to explore how performance is related to different co-authorship network measures and to disclose interﬁeld differences. The number of co-authors (degree centrality) and the strength of links show a positive relationship with the g-index in the three ﬁelds. Local cohesion presents a negative relationship with the g-index in the two experimental ﬁelds, where open networks and the diversity of co-authors seem to be beneﬁcial. No clear advantages from intermediary positions (high betweenness) or from being linked to well-connected authors (high eigenvector) can be inferred from this analysis. In terms of g-index, the beneﬁts derived by authors from their position in co-authorship networks are larger in the two experimental ﬁelds than in the theoretical one.},

	abstract = {In this study, we develop a theoretical model based on social network theories and analytical methods for exploring collaboration (co-authorship) networks of scholars. We use measures from social network analysis (SNA) (i.e., normalized degree centrality, normalized closeness centrality, normalized betweenness centrality, normalized eigenvector centrality, average ties strength, and efﬁciency) for examining the effect of social networks on the (citation-based) performance of scholars in a given discipline (i.e., information systems). Results from our statistical analysis using a Poisson regression model suggest that research performance of scholars (g-index) is positively correlated with four SNA measures except for the normalized betweenness centrality and the normalized closeness centrality measures. Furthermore, it reveals that only normalized degree centrality, efﬁciency, and average ties strength have a positive signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the g-index (as a performance measure). The normalized eigenvector centrality has a negative signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the g-index. Based on these results, we can imply that scholars, who are connected to many distinct scholars, have a better citation-based performance (g-index) than scholars with fewer connections. Additionally, scholars with large average ties strengths (i.e., repeated co-authorships) show a better research performance than those with low tie strengths (e.g., single co-authorships with many different scholars). The results related to efﬁciency show that scholars, who maintain a strong co-authorship relationship to only one co-author of a group of linked co-authors, perform better than those researchers with many relationships to the same group of linked co-authors. The negative effect of the normalized eigenvector suggests that scholars should work with many students instead of other well-performing scholars. Consequently, we can state that the professional social network of researchers can be used to predict the future performance of researchers.},

While the proportion of direct selfcitations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10\% of references) and the social sciences (20\%), the same cannot be said for citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of coauthorship which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network. Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration network, excluding direct self-citations. These results are interpreted in terms of small-scale structure, field-specific citation practices, and the value of local co-author networks for the production of knowledge and for the accumulation of symbolic capital. Given the various levels of integration between co-authors, our findings shed light on the question of the availability of ‘arm’s length’ expert reviewers of grant applications and manuscripts.},

Based on career and publication data of virtually all sociologists working in German sociology departments, we test how meritocratic factors (academic productivity) as well as non-meritocratic factors (ascription, symbolic and social capital) inﬂuence the chances of getting a permanent professorship in sociology. Our ﬁndings show that getting tenure in sociology is strongly related to scholarly output, as previous studies have shown. Improving on existing studies, however, we show speciﬁcally that each refereed journal article and each monograph increases a sociologist’s chance for tenure by 10 to 15 percent, while other publications affect odds for tenure only marginally and in some cases even negatively. Regarding non-meritocratic factors, we show that network size, individual reputation, and gender matters. Women get their ﬁrst permanent position as university professor with on average 23 to 44 percent fewer publications than men; all else being equal, they are about 1.4 times more likely to get tenure than men. The article generally contributes to a better understanding of the role of meritocratic and non-meritocratic factors in achieving scarce and highly competitive job positions in academia.},

The results show a rise in the average number of authors, share of co-authored and international co-authored articles in the majority of the subject categories.

The subject categories with a great share of international coauthored articles have generally experienced an increase in co-authorship, but increasing international collaboration is not the only factor inﬂuencing the rise in co-authorship. Hence, the most substantial rises have occurred in subject categories, where the research often is based on the use of experiments, large data set, statistical methods and/or teamproduction models.},

To answer these questions, we examine trends in collaboration over a 70 year period and empirically test a variety of explanations for the increase in collaboration that we find. We analyze data collected from a stratified random sample of articles in two leading sociology journals between 1935 and 2005 (n=1274). Most of our analyses are descriptive and display trends over time. However, we pool the data across all years and estimate logistic regression models to assess the relative contribution of various factors. We find that the importance of geographical location has been waning since the 1950s, although the growth in cross-place collaborations stagnated between 1980 and 2005. We find that quantitative research is more likely to be collaborative, as are projects requiring data collection, though this may change because the collaboration rate among secondary data users is increasing at a faster rate. We find no significant gender differences in rates of collaboration, although male sole-authorship remains the most common form of publication. We also find the institutional prestige of coauthors is typically higher than that of sole-authors. Our results elucidate the extent of collaboration in sociology and reveal how several factors have contributed to this major shift in work organization.},

In this paper, we distinguish between collaboration at different levels and show that inter-institutional and international collaboration need not necessarily involve inter-individual collaboration. We also show that co-authorship is no more than a partial indicator of collaboration. Lastly, we argue for a more symmetrical approach in comparing the costs of collaboration with the undoubted benefits when considering policies towards research collaboration. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {One challenge for most scientists is avoiding and resolving issues that center around authorship and the publishing of scientiﬁc manuscripts. While trying to place the research in proper context, impart new knowledge, follow proper guidelines, and publish in the most appropriate journal, the scientist often must deal with multi-collaborator issues like authorship allocation, trust and dependence, and resolution of publication conﬂicts. Most guidelines regarding publications, commentaries, and editorials have evolved from the ranks of editors in an effort to diminish the issues that faced them as editors. For example, the Ingelﬁnger rule attempts to prevent duplicate publications of the same study. This paper provides a historical overview of commonly encountered scientiﬁc authorship issues, a comparison of opinions on these issues, and the inﬂuence of various organizations and guidelines in regards to these issues. For example, a number of organizations provide guidelines for author allocation; however, a comparison shows that these guidelines differ on who should be an author, rules for ordering authors, and the level of responsibility for coauthors. Needs that emerge from this review are (a) a need for more controlled studies on authorship issues, (b) an increased awareness and a buy-in to consensus views by non-editor groups, e.g., managers, authors, reviewers, and scientiﬁc societies, and (c) a need for editors to express a greater understanding of authors’ dilemmas and to exhibit greater ﬂexibility. Also needed are occasions (e.g., an international congress) when editors and others (managers, authors, etc.) can directly exchange views, develop consensus approaches and solutions, and seek agreement on how to resolve authorship issues. Open dialogue is healthy, and it is essential for scientiﬁc integrity to be protected so that younger scientists can conﬁdently follow the lead of their predecessors.},

We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},
