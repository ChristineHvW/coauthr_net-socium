# SOCIUM Co-Authorship Network
### Data and code to construct a co-authorship network of the SOCIUM research facility (University of Bremen).  

For a term paper I constructed a co-authorship network of the mentioned research facility. Data has been taken from the SOCIUM website (https://www.socium.uni-bremen.de/publications/en/?). The data is described further in the paper (**socium_coauthorship.pdf**).  

The file **socpub_all_sci.xlsx** contains a table listing the authors, the name and the publication date of the respective publication.  

The file **auth_attributes.xlsx** contains author attributes (department membership and number of publications).  

The file **socpub_coauth_final.R** contains R-code to reproduce the network operations and statistical analyses of the paper.  

To recreate the graphs installation of the software _visone_ (https://visone.info/) is necessary.
